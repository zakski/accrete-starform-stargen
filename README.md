Accrete/Starform/Stargen
========================

## Intro

Accrete's origin dates back to the late 60's when Stephen H. Dole published "Formation of Planetary Systems by 
Aggregation: A Computer Simulation". 

It grew to prominence in the 80's/90's after a recreated version of the source code based on a subsequent paper by 
Martyn J. Fogg was released into the fertile ground that was the now defunct USML mailing list.

Since then there have been numerous versions, and the work on this module is primarily focused on preserving the 
timeline of events that I have pieced together.

This project is split into three sections:
 
 1. the 1st is research into who was interested in the algorithm on Usenet, on Mailing Lists, on Github, etc and then 
    the subsequent retrieval of any distinct old copies of the code, particularly in the pre-github days where these 
    represent snapshots of development done by various authors. I have placed my research and analysis of the data into
    the docs folder.
 
 2. the 2nd is making an attempt to compile and run these programs on windows where possible. Several of this were
    written pre-windows, in an era prior to microsoft's dominance of the pc market, so they are mostly designed for now 
    obsolete compilers and need little tweaks to get to run. these will primarily be represented in their own branches
    or modules.
  
 3. the 3rd and final section is a recreation of all the little variations into one program that can be used to play 
    around with all the authors' variations and eventually streamlined into something a lot less clunky than it is 
    currently.

## Papers

The Research Papers that inspired all the extant accrete code. Contains most of the mathematics necessary to construct 
the basic models on a home computer.

At some point I hope to go back through these and find improvements / enhancements suggested by papers that cite these 
and add them to my recreation as options.
