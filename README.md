Accrete/Starform/Stargen
========================

## Intro

Accrete's origin dates back to the late 60's when Stephen H. Dole published "Formation of Planetary Systems by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation". 

It grew to prominence in the 80's/90's after a recreated version of the source code based on a subsequent paper by Martyn J. Fogg was released into the fertile 
ground that was the now defunct USML mailing list.

Since then there have been numerous versions, and the work on this module is primarily focused on preserving the timeline of events that I have pieced together.

This project is split into three sections:
 
 1. the 1st is research into who was interested in the algorithm on Usenet, on Mailing Lists, on Github, etc and then the subsequent retrieval of any 
 distinct old copies of the code, particularly in the pre-github days where these represent snapshots of development done by various authors. I will compile 
 my research and analysis of the data into the docs folder.
 
 2. the 2nd is making an attempt to compile and run these programs on windows where possible. Several of this were written pre-windows, in an era prior to 
 microsoft's dominance of the pc market, so they are mostly designed for now obsolete compilers and need little tweaks to get to run. these will primarily 
 represented in their own branches or releases, while the master branch will be concerned primarily with the 3rd section.
  
 3. the 3rd and final section is a recreation of all the little variations into one program that can be used to play around with all the authors' variations 
 and eventually streamlined into something a lot less clunky than it is currently.

## Papers

The Research Papers that inspired all the extant accrete code. Contains most of the mathematics necessary to construct the basic models on a home computer.

At some point I hope to go back through these and find improvements / enhancements suggested by papers that cite these and add them to my recreation as 
options.
