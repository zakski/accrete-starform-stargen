Stephen H. Dole wrote the original program and research paper that detailed the solar system formation simulation code. He was a prolific astronomy 
researcher and whilst I have not recovered his original source code; I have a reliable recreation of his original engine based on his papers that exist online, 
with the exception of the random number generator that he used.
