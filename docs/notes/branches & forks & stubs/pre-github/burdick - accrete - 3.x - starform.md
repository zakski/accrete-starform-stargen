- Burdick Version: V3.0
- Key: Burdick.1994.B

Mat Burdick's third iteration of his simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. 

Like the other iterations this seems to be the main fork of source code that everyone seems to of worked off. Unfortunately I was unable 
to detect a site belonging to him that still hosted his source code so third party hosted copies will have to do.

Accrete2 and Starform are names given to this iteration fairly interchangeably.

- Key: Malloy.1993

Most up-to-date version of Matt Burdick's code, was labelled V3.1 by Sean Malloy. 

It has the complete source code, and seems to be a higher version than the others.
 
It was wrapped into a shar in 1993, but Malloy had been sitting on it for a while, so it is difficult to place its 
precise place in the timeline.
