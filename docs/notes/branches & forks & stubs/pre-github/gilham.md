Gilham wrote a variant based on Dole's original paper in Icarus in the late '60s. It appeared in the gaming magazine White Dwarf issue 58/57 (UK/US) which was 
published in October 1984. He may have also released it on usenet, but such a post is missing from google groups.

Steve wrote a port of his original basic code to c++. Like his original basic code, its pretty interesting to see code that has not evolved along the burdick
branch.

This is pre-ISO C++, so cannot be compiled by gcc as is.
