###[ACCRETION](http://znark.com/create/accrete.html)

- Resource Name: 1994 - Matt Burdick - Accretion
- Author: Matt Burdick
- Poster/Publisher: Ian Burrell
- Language: Turbo Pascal
- Creation Year: 1988
- Source Year: 1994
- Parents: Fogg.1985
- Original Source: Acquired.
- Reproducibility: Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Burdick.1988

Mat Burdick's simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. The main fork of source code that everyone seems to of worked off.

This pretty close to being the original copy of Mat Burdick's first version, In that it is written in pascal which apparently is his original language and the 
comments mention copyright 1988. However the fact that the source code was found on Ian Burrell's website and the files were last modified in 1994 count 
against it being the very first version. Additionally the zip file was also labelled accretion, which has never been a name that Burdick has called it. 

Burdick could only partially reproduce Fogg's work, since the way that Fogg determined the atmosphere type is not cleared marked out in his research paper.

Nevertheless, this codebase is the parent of the vast majority of variations that have any source code still extant. 

###[Accrete](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/2Xm6WP5n1F8)

- Resource Name: 1988 - Matt Budick - Accrete -  Steve Gilham Incomplete
- Author: Matt Burdick
- Poster/Publisher: Steve Gilham
- Language: C
- Creation Year: >= 1988
- Source Year: 1993
- Parent: Burdick.1988
- Original Source: Incomplete.
- Reproducibility: [Partially Reproducible.](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/Gilham1988.md)
- Burdick Version: None
- Key: Gilham.1988

A version of Matt Burdick's code, ported by him to C from pascal. Was posted to a usernet newsgroup by Steve Gilham. Whilst it does seem to date back to 1988, 
the end of Gilham's post was cut off in the Google Group archive, so the code is incomplete.

###[ACCRETE](http://znark.com/create/files/accrete.zip)
- Resource Name: 1994 - Matt Burdick - Accrete
- Author: Mat Burdick
- Poster/Publisher: Ian Burell
- Language: C
- Creation Year: >= 1988
- Source Year: 1994
- Parents: Gilham.1988
- Original Source: Complete.
- Reproducibility: Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Burdick.1994.A

One of Mat Burdick's C versions which is commonly distributed as accrete.
 
This looks like The same major version as the incomplete code gilham supplied so it should make for an interesting comparison.  

###[ACCRETE](http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usml.html)
- Resource Name: 1995 - Nyrath - Accrete
- Author: Matt Burdick
- Poster/Publisher: Nyrath the nearly wise
- Language: C
- Creation Year: >= 1988
- Source Year: 1995
- Parents: Burdick.1994.A
- Original Source: Acquired.
- Reproducibility: Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Nyrath.1995

Nyrath, like Burrell and a few others, has a cached copy of what I assume is one of the first gen iterations of Burdick's accrete program. This version is 
dated as been last modified later than Burrell's copy, so we have a potential version order between them.
