Mat Burdick's third iteration of his simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. 

Like the other iterations this seems to be the main fork of source code that everyone seems to of worked off. Unfortunately I was unable 
to detect a site belonging to him that still hosted his source code so third party hosted copies will have to do.

Accrete2 and Starform are names given to this iteration fairly interchangeably.

Nyrath, like Burrell and a few others, has a cached copy of what I assume is one of the first gen iterations of Burdick's accrete program. This version is 
dated as been last modified later than Burrell's copy, so we have a potential version order between them.

More up-to-date version of Matt Burdick's code, ported to C from pascal. Was given to Ian Burrell by Sean Malloy. 

It has the complete source code, and seems to be a higher version than the one posted by Steve Gilham, however the name change suggests that there is at least 
one intermediate version between the two.
 
It was wrapped into a shar in 1993, but Malloy had been sitting on it for a while, so it is difficult to place its precise place in the timeline.
