# Missing Implementations

## ACCRETE 1a/1b

- Resource Name: n/a
- Author: Dave Allen
- Poster/Publisher: n/a
- Language: IBM Basic
- Creation Year: <= 1988

Dave Allen claims in usml to have written variations of Accrete, 1a to allow captured moons rather than coalesce straight away. The second one, 1b, an attempt
to simulate moon systems, as well as potentially an original version. 

I cannot currently find any source code of these programs online so his branches are considered to end with him and its hard to see how they fit into the big
picture. Most likely given other variations that I do have the source code for, it either comes from a direct recreation of Dole's paper or is based of one 
of Burdick's early recreations.

Choinski wrote a variation on burdick's accrete/starform program for the 2300ad RPG. It uses a combination of the World Builder's Guid, the Director's guide 
and accrete. I cannot currently find any source code of this program online, so this branch is considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where it 
fits into the bigger picture.

Jon Leech claims that Wales wrote a variation based on Dole's 1970 paper. I cannot currently find any source code of this program online, so this branch is 
considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where it fits into the bigger picture.
