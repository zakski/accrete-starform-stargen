# Computer Simulations of Planetary Accretion Dynamics: Sensitivity to Initial Conditions

A review/critique of the initial parameters and formulae of Dole's model written in 1977 by R. Isaacman and Carl Sagan.

Isaacman and Sagan vary Dole's model to try to correct some of its shortcomings and to make the algorithm more capable of generating generic systems, not 
just ones that are earth-like.

## Based On.

see [notes on Dole's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/Formation%20of%20Planetary%20Systems%20by%20Aggregation.md)


## Examinations/Changes

- look at initial gas ratio. K = 100 is noted to definitely be the upper limit, but K as low as 10 can allow for the generation of plausible systems.

- A correction for taking into account the vertical portion of the gas/dust density distribution.

- General investigation into the alteration of the density distribution formula.  

- Exponent for the dust sweep distance could be changed to 1/3 from 1/4, due to new research on a related topic.

- Notes an alternative for the retention of gas formula.

## Notes


- looks at the choices of orbital eccentricity for the dust cloud

- Would prefer parallel growth and injection of plantismals as opposed to the sequential process dole uses.

- Cost of the computing time of running simulations of Dole's paper on an IBM 370/168 ran to approximately $1 per solar system.

- Varying the planetismal seed mass from Dole's original value has no effect on the final results.


## Conclusions

that ACRETE is missing some of the essential physics of solar system cosmogony, or that planetary systems of our type are only one example in a rich array of
alternative varieties of planetary systems. 

Likewise, more fundamental changes in the nebular morphology (e.g. from an exponential to a power law density 
distribution function) generate planetary systems some of which, although they do not closely resemble our own, are not fundamentally objectionable.
