# Authors of Implementations

## Intro

This file contains a brief description of each examined implementations. Research papers, source code and/or more 
detailed readmes, if they exist, will be deposited into the models folder, whilst descriptions of their operation and 
reproducability will be placed in notes under build descriptions.
 
Additionally in the notes folder, I will place my proposed arrangement of the various branches and forks. 

Initial model order will be according to the resource name.

Stephen H. Dole wrote the original program and research paper that detailed the solar system formation simulation 
code. He was a prolific astronomy researcher and whilst I have not recovered his original source code; I have a reliable 
recreations of his original engine based on his papers that exist online, with the exception of the random number 
generator that he used as that would be machine dependent.

- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Sagan.1977

Programmed by J.Rice and provided to Sagan by Stephen H. Dole. Isaacman and Sagan modified the original to scrutinise 
the sensitivity of the starting conditions. They come to the conclusion that Acrete is either missing some essential 
physics of solar system cosmogony or that planetary systems similar to our own are only one variety out of many 
different possible planetary systems.

Most recreations of Accrete do not directly use this paper as their inspiration.

Gilham wrote a variant based on Dole's original paper in Icarus in the late '60s. It appeared in the gaming magazine 
White Dwarf issue 58/57 (UK/US) which was published in October 1984. He may have also released it on usenet, but such a 
post is missing from google groups.

Martyn J. Fogg wrote a subsequent research paper that attempted to vary the mass of the star and build up information 
about the potential atmosphere of each planet in the generated system. 

Brian Davis reports that he wrote Fogg to request the source, and he replied that is was on a discarded machine in his 
garage, and even he wouldn't retrieve it, but write it from scratch again if the situation ever came up. Thus far no one 
seems to of replicated his planetary classification system.

- Burdick Version: 1.x
- Key: Gilham.1988

A version of Matt Burdick's code, ported by him to C from pascal. Was posted to a usernet newsgroup by Steve 
Gilham. Whilst it does seem to date back to 1988, the end of Gilham's post was cut off in the Google Group archive, so 
the code is incomplete.

### [Starform](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.design/xp8edV1wyIE)

Most up-to-date version of Matt Burdick's code, was labelled V3.1 by Sean Malloy.

It has the complete source code, and seems to be a higher version than the others.

It was wrapped into a shar in 1993, but Malloy had been sitting on it for a while, so it is difficult to place its
precise place in the timeline.

- Burdick Version: 1.x
- Key: Burdick.1994.A

One of Mat Burdick's C versions which is commonly distributed as accrete.
 
This looks like the same major version as the incomplete code gilham supplied so it should make for an interesting 
comparison.  

### [ACCRETION](http://znark.com/create/accrete.html)

- Resource Name: 1994 - Matt Burdick - Accretion
- Author: Matt Burdick
- Poster/Publisher: Ian Burrell
- Language: Turbo Pascal
- Creation Year: 1988

- Original Source: Acquired.
- Reproducibility: [Reproducible.](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1990s/1994%20-%20Burdick.1988.md)
- Burdick Version: 1.x
- Key: Burdick.1988

Mat Burdick's simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. The main fork of source code that everyone 
seems to of worked off.

This pretty close to being the original copy of Mat Burdick's first version, In that it is written in pascal which 
apparently is his original language and the comments mention copyright 1988. However the fact that the source code was 
found on Ian Burrell's website and the files were last modified in 1994 count against it being the very first 
version. Additionally the zip file was also labelled accretion, which has never been a name that Burdick has called it. 

Burdick could only partially reproduce Fogg's work, since the way that Fogg determined the atmosphere type is not 
cleared marked out in his research paper.

Nevertheless, this codebase is the parent of the vast majority of variations that have any source code still extant. 

### [Starform](http://znark.com/create/accrete.html)
- Resource Name: 1994 - Matt Burdick - Starform
- Author: Matt Burdick

- Original Source: Acquired.
- Reproducibility: [Reproducible](/docs/notes/build descriptions/1990s/1994%20-%20Burdick.1994.B.md).
- Burdick Version: V3.0
- Key: Burdick.1994.B

Mat Burdick's third iteration of his simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. 

Like the other iterations this seems to be the main fork of source code that everyone seems to of worked 
off. Unfortunately I was unable to detect a site belonging to him that still hosted his source code so third party 
hosted copies will have to do.

Accrete2 and Starform are names given to this iteration fairly interchangeably.


### [ACCRETION](http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usml.html)
- Resource Name: 1995 - Andrew Folkins - Accretion
- Author: Andrew Folkins
- Poster/Publisher: Steve Dang
- Language: C
- Creation Year: >= 1988
- Source Year: 1995
- Parents: Dole.1969, Dole.1970
- Original Source: Acquired.
- Reproducibility: [Reproducible](/docs/notes/build descriptions/1990s/1995%20-%20Folkins.1988.md).
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Folkins.1988

Andrew Folkins at some point published a version of accrete for the amiga, which was then modified by keris, 
unfortunately it was packed up in a shar which has a different last modified date than the wrapping header info, so I am 
uncertain about this version's exact date.

Like Steve Gilham, his line of code is at least initially distinct from Burdick's.

### [ACCRETE](http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usml.html)
- Resource Name: 1995 - Nyrath - Accrete

- Burdick Version: 1.x
- Key: Nyrath.1995

Nyrath, like Burrell and a few others, has a cached copy of what I assume is one of the first gen iterations of
Burdick's accrete program. This version is dated as been last modified later than Burrell's copy, so we have a potential
version order between them.

### [Starform](http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usml.html)

Steve wrote a port of his original basic code to c++. Like his original basic code, its pretty interesting to see code
that has not evolved along the burdick branch.

This is pre-ISO C++, so cannot be compiled by gcc as is.

Erik Max Francis produced a slightly modified version of Burdick's code that prints it's output slightly differently. It 
seems to extends from the first generation code line but I am unsure as to which variant is the closest to being the 
actual parent.

Christopher E. Webb developed an updated version of his code that uses traveller rpg information more substantially.

This copy was found on Joseph Heck's website with the label of Accrete3, but is labelled Accrete2 mod 1 in the readme

Ian Burrell's version, which given the information I have a available, seems to ported from some code provided by Sean 
Malloy.

Only the portion of Burdick's code relating to Dole's paper seems to of been ported to Java, but it has provided me the 
initial understanding of how accretion and Burdick's code works. 

Burrell's code is loosely based on Burdick's source code, but takes a much more rigid object-oriented approach.

Carl Burke, like Ian Burell, wrote his own java applet version of starform/accrete. He also was aware of Ian Burell's 
work and I wonder how much it influenced him.
 
In any case, He has written several versions in Pascal, C, Modula-2, C++ as well Java, but only this java version seems 
to remain.

A version based on Andrew Folkins, hacked about by Keris, removing some of his optimisations and added gas accretion for 
normal planets to give some sort of atmosphere, it seems to work reasonably. The output formats are (of course) totally

## Missing Implementations

### ACCRETE 1a/1b

- Resource Name: n/a
- Author: Dave Allen
- Poster/Publisher: n/a
- Language: IBM Basic
- Creation Year: <= 1988
- Source Year: ????
- Parent: Dole.1969, Dole.1970 or Burdick.1988 most likely
- Original Source: Missing.
- Reproducibility: Unreproducible.
- Key: Allen.????

Dave Allen claims in usml to have written variations of Accrete, 1a to allow captured moons rather than coalesce 
straight away. The second one, 1b, an attempt to simulate moon systems, as well as potentially an original version. 

I cannot currently find any source code of these programs online so his branches are considered to end with him and its 
hard to see how they fit into the big picture. Most likely given other variations that I do have the source code for, it 
either comes from a direct recreation of Dole's paper or is based of one of Burdick's early recreations.

Choinski wrote a variation on burdick's accrete/starform program for the 2300ad RPG. It uses a combination of the World 
Builder's Guid, the Director's guide and accrete. I cannot currently find any source code of this program online, so 
this branch is considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where it fits into the bigger picture.

Jon Leech claims that Wales wrote a variation based on Dole's 1970 paper. I cannot currently find any source code of
