- Source Year: 1969
- Parents: n/a, the original
- Original Source: Research paper, but no code
- Reproducibility: Completely Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Dole.1969

Stephen H. Dole wrote the original program and research paper that detailed the solar system formation simulation code. He was a prolific astronomy 
researcher and whilst I have not recovered his original source code; I have a reliable recreations of his original engine based on his papers that exist 
online, with the exception of the random number generator that he used as that would be machine dependent.

Stephen H. Dole presented the original research paper findings in Icarus in 1970. The program that used is basically identical to the one written for the 
Rand Corporation.

- Resource Name: 1977 - Isaacmam & Sagan - Computer Simulations of Planetary Accretion Dynamics: Sensitivity to Initial Conditions
- Author: Richard Isaacman & Carl Sagan
- Poster/Publisher: Cornell University
- Language: Most likely FORTRAN due to it being written for a IBM 7044.
- Creation Year: 1977
- Source Year: 1977
- Parents: Dole.1969, Dole.1970
- Original Source: Research paper, but no code
- Reproducibility: Possibly Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Sagan.1977

Programmed by J.Rice and provided to Sagan by Stephen H. Dole. Isaacman and Sagan modified the original to scrutinise the sensitivity of the starting 
conditions. They come to the conclusion that Acrete is either missing some essential physics of solar system cosmogony or that planetary systems similar to 
our own are only one variety out of many different possible planetary systems.

Most recreations of Accrete do not directly use this paper as their inspiration.

- Resource Name: 1985 - Martyn J. Fogg - Extra-Solar Planetary Systems A Microcomputer Simulation
- Author: Martyn J. Fogg
- Poster/Publisher: Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 
- Language: BBC Basic
- Creation Year: 1985
- Source Year: 1985
- Parents: Dole.1969, Dole.1970, Sagan.1977
- Original Source: Gone.
- Reproducibility: Partially Reproducible.
- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Fogg.1985

Martyn J. Fogg wrote a subsequent research paper that attempted to vary the mass of the star and build up information about the potential atmosphere of each 
planet in the generated system. 

Brian Davis reports that he wrote Fogg to request the source, and he replied that is was on a discarded machine in his 
garage, and even he wouldn't retrieve it, but write it from scratch again if the situation ever came up. Thus far no one seems to of replicated his planetary 
classification system.
