Andrew Folkins at some point published a version of accrete for the amiga, which was then modified by keris, unfortunately it was packed up in a shar which 
has a different last modified date than the wrapping header info, so I am uncertain about this version's exact date.

Like Steve Gilham, his line of code is at least initially distinct from Burdick's.

A version based on Andrew Folkins, hacked about by Keris, removing some of his optimisations and added gas accretion for normal planets to give some sort of 
atmosphere, it seems to work reasonably. The output formats are (of course) totally different from starform.

This is Andrew Folkins' code again, but converted to C++. It's even more hacked about.
