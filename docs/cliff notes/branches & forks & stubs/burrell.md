Ian Burrell's version, which given the information I have a available, seems to ported from some code provided by Sean Malloy.

Only the portion of Burdick's code relating to Dole's paper seems to of been ported to Java, but it has provided me the initial understanding of how 
accretion and Burdick's code works. 

Burrell's code is loosely based on Burdick's source code, but takes a much more rigid object-oriented approach.
