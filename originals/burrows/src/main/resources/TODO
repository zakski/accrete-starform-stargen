Things I intend to do with Starform, as of 1999.04.19:

  Tidy up the variable names - having variables with names like 'age' in the
  global namespace is asking for trouble, and other names are much too long.

  Convert it to C++, making it a (set of) class(es).  That will also solve the
  name problem above.

  Have a look at proper moon generation, and possibly asteroid belts and rings
  as well.  (You can get asteroid belts simply by smashing up planets, of
  course, which used to be how they were thought to occur.  Same with rings by
  breaking up moons.  However, I believe current theories are on the lines of
  them being planets that failed to coalesce...)

  Separate out the environmental stuff more.  As it is, it's designed for
  Earth-like planets, but we know that most of the ones in our solar system
  (the solid ones, that is, gas giants are a totally different beast) don't
  seem to be at all similar.

  Generate stars separately.  I want to be able to generate stars first, then
  later generate planetary systems for those stars which seem likely (for
  instance ignoring type M and type O stars).  The current system only
  generates type IV to VI stars of class F to K anyway, a more realistic one
  should generate the whole range including doubles.
