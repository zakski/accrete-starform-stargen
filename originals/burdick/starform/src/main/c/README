        This program is based on an article by Martyn Fogg in the Journal of the
        British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) called 'Extrasolar Planetary Systems:
        a Microcomputer Simulation'.  In it, he described how to generate various
        sun-like solar systems randomly.  Since he did a good job of listing
        references, I decided to implement it in Turbo Pascal on my PC.
        
        Later, I translated it to C for portability, and the result is what you see
        in front of you.  Because of my need to run this on an IBM-PC, there are two
        makefiles included with the program: 'Makefile' (for unix systems), and
        'starform.mak' for MS-DOS systems.  To create the executable on a unix
        system, type in 'make' alone; type 'make starform.mak' if you are on
        an MS-DOS machine and using Microsoft C.
        
        Thanks go to Sean Malloy (malloy@nprdc.arpa) for his help with the random
        number routines and for testing it on other machines and to Marty Shannon
        (m...@mozart.att.com) for the lisp-style output format.
        
        As a warning, don't be surprised if the program take a while to run.  Here
        are some sample run times:
                2-5 seconds user time on my HP9000/350
                5-30 seconds on a Sun-3/60
                5-8 seconds on an 8087-equipped 10MHz IBM-T
                4 minutes on an 8 MHz IBM-PC
                7 minutes on a normal IBM-PC
        
        If you don't have verbose mode on, no output will appear until all of the
        calculations are done, so don't be surprised if it doesn't appear to do
        anything for a while.
        
        Enjoy, and if you find any glaring inconsistancies or interesting pieces to
        add to the simulation, let me know and I'll include it in any other
        distributions I send out.

        subject; only the most interesting of many that were listed in Fogg's
